# GmRunner

## Migrated to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ryi3r/GmRunner)

This is a GameMaker runner, it is meant to be an open-source runner with the ability to run various games.
The project is still in early **WORK IN PROGRESS**, therefore it cannot run anything yet.

It can run the DELTARUNE launcher with major graphical bugs, and cannot run any other Toby projects so far.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute! Any contributions are welcome.

## Issues

This code has a tendency to fail emulating bytecode every now and then, if you can contribute to this that will be very appreciated (though I'm sorry about the spaghetti code), or you may also report an issue and I may look into it.

## Credits

Major thanks to the Underminers team for creating [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool) and [Underanalyzer](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/Underanalyzer), so that this project could even become a thing.
